# CustomFontsSAC

> **OUTDATED - Please use official UI5 CDN instead of this repository:** While hosting the font file yourself will still work, meanwhile there is a much simpler way using the official UI5 CDN. The font definition file is included in the UI5 shipment and can be linked directley from SAC. Please use this URL to link the font:

Demo repository to showcase usage of custom icon fonts in SAC.<br/>
The `gh-pages` branch hosts the SAP Fiori icon font released with [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/).

> **Note:** For demonstration purposes only, we use the `gh-pages` branch to host the custom font definition files. Be advised that this is **not recommended for productive use**. You can host the files similarly on any kind of publicly available webserver or cloud infrastructure, though.

## Instructions

1. To use the SAP Fiori Icon Font in SAP Analytics Cloud, host a simple [font definition file](https://michadelic.github.io/CustomFontsSAC/SAP-icons.css) on a public server:

 ``` css
 /* SAP Fiori Icons */
 @font-face {
   font-family: 'SAP Fiori Icons';
   src:
     url('https://<yourserver>/path/to/SAP-icons.woff2') format('woff2'),
     url('https://<yourserver>/path/to/SAP-icons.woff') format('woff'),
     url('https://<yourserver>/path/to/SAP-icons.ttf') format('truetype');
   font-weight: normal;
   font-style: normal;
 }
 ```

2. Download the three font files `sap-icons.ttf`, `sap-icons.woff`, `sap-icons.woff2` from the latest UI5 shipment and put it right next to the definition file.

   * [SAP-Icons.woff2](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap/ui/core/themes/base/fonts/SAP-icons.woff2)
   * [SAP-Icons.woff](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap/ui/core/themes/base/fonts/SAP-icons.woff)
   * [SAP-Icons.ttf](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap/ui/core/themes/base/fonts/SAP-icons.ttf)

3. Add the font definition URL to the SAC custom web font settings (see documentation link below).
